# AdalineML

Adaline/Perceptron Model Template Sourced from Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka 


LinearModelBase.py -> Primary algorithm; allows for users to train and test Perceptron & (Batch Gradient) Adaline Models on custom csv datasets
SummitSuccess.csv -> Linearly-seperated, synthetic dataset used to investigate algorithm behavior
weights.csv -> Logs weights after each epoch; can be used to test for convergence with the perceptron model
SoccerGoalData.csv -> Non-linearly seperated, synthetic dataset used to demonstrate the pitfalls of linear ML models like Perceptron & Adaline



Dependencies:
numpy
csv
